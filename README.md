## AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional

Contains notes and resources I used to study for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional (SAP-C01) Exam.

## My Background
I am from the Azure side of the cloud with more than 10 years of professional IT experience. 5 of those 10 years helping customers build cloud infrastucture. I have various expert-level Azure certifications under my belt. Decided to explore a bit more and see what AWS offers.
